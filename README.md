## Description
This challenge we were assigned to recreate a portfolio website. The site had to be created to look like the image provided using only HTML and CSS. Things that needed to be considered were that the page had to be responsive to other page sizes and provide a accessible experience to all users. Also, that there was a lot of CSS elements that needed to be transformed on hover. The assignment gave good practice on how to understand and use flexbox and page interactions.
